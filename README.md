This code is for the readers of the book (see https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PXHJCXY), and for personal use only. For commercial use please reach out (my email is in the book's preface and back cover).

I ask that you please post an honest review of the book on Amazon.com in return. The feedback I got so far for the previous editions has been limited, and I need it to improve the book further. This is hobby project that is worked on weekends/evenings, so any assistance is greatly appreciated.

All reusable code is in .h files, and test*.cpp files allow testing various parts of it.

The code has been reasonably tested, but no guarantees are made about its quality or behavior. I.e. the code is provided "as is", without any implicit warranty of merchantability. So don't use it in pacemakers, nuclear reactors, etc.

Github seems to have a bug in downloading the slides--the best way to get them is to download the entire repository.
